    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Roti is a popular Caribbean dish consisting of soft, unleavened flatbread filled with various savory ingredients such as curried meats, vegetables, and chutneys. It is known for its deliciously spiced fillings and the flaky, tender texture of the roti bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 Teaspoons baking powder
            </li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 Cups lukewarm water (you might use more or less it depends upon the weather and how much moisture is in the air)</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ Cup oil (or ghee) to prepare (stuff) the roti</li>
            <li>½ Cup oil for baking the roti</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>To Make the Dough</h3></li>
            <p>In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the middle and add the oil, gradually add the water mixing with your hand, making sure not to overwork the dough. The dough should be sticky and shaggy, and look like it is just coming together. Cover the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes.</p>
            <li><h3>To Prepare the Buss Up Shot (aka “Roti”)…</h3></li>
            <p>Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. On a lightly floured surface roll the dough into a 6 to 8 inch disk. Grease the disk with vegetable oil, and roll the disc jelly roll style, you will have a long roll of dough. Next, tightly curl the long piece of dough into a disc tucking the end into the center. While working with the dough try not to work too much flour into the dough. The secret to a nice soft roti is not to add too much extra flour. Let the dough rest for another 20 minutes.</p>
            <li><h3>To Bake the Buss Up Shot…</h3></li>
            <p>Heat the tawa, dry cast iron skillet, or griddle over a medium heat until hot. On a very lightly floured surface, working with 1 ball at a time press the dough into a small flat circle about 4 inches wide. Next use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 10 inch round making sure the edges are not thick. Flip and rotate the dough as you are rolling out the dough. Remember try not to use too much flour.

                Pick up the dough in the palm of your hand and lay it flat on the tawah. Let it bake for 1 minute, and little bubbles appear or until the sides look like they are drying out. Flip the roti and brush it with about ½ teaspoon of oil, making sure to cover the whole roti skin and the ends. As soon as your have finished brushing the roti flip it and brush the other side with oil.
                
                When you have finished brushing the roti, fold it into quarters, remove it from the heat. Immediately clap it, or place it in a tupperware container with a tightly fitting lid and shake the container vigorously. Remove the roti skin from the container and wrap it in a clean dry dish cloth. Repeat the process until all the balls have been cooked. Let the roti skins rest for 10 minutes before serving. While sitting in the dishcloth the roti skins will steam and become soft.
                
                Well wrapped roti skins can be kept in the freezer for a month.</p>
