        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            the Best Bread for Grilled Cheese is… <br>
            White bread! Thick-sliced, if you can find it. Regular, squishy, tender white bread will crisp up beautifully in the skillet and make a toasty, nicely
            neutral vehicle for all that cheese. To give you that perfect Grilled sandwitch that we all want.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            8 Slices thick white bread <br>
            4 tbsp good mayonnaise <br>
            4 tbsp room temperature butter <br>
            1 lb Cheddar (or your favorite cheese)
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            1. In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise and butter until fully combined. <br>
            2. Assembly sandwiches by spreading the butter-mayo mixture on one side of each piece of bread. <br>
            3. On the inside of the bread add 1/2 cup of grated cheese and top with second piece of bread that is prepared with the same butter/mayo combo. <br>
            4. Add prepared sandwich to a cold cast iron skillet and turn heat on to low.
              Carefully watch to make sure that you aren’t burning the butter-mayo, flip as
              soon as one side is golden brown and continue with other side. 
              This process should take 8-10 min on each side. Do not rush this process or you will compromise 
              the crispy golden crust of a perfect grilled cheese. <br>
            5. Once both sides are golden brown, transfer to a plate and serve!
