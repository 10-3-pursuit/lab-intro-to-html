               <b>Ingredients</b>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                         Rolled Oats: Use quick oats or gluten-free oats, if needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Milk: Use your favorite milk you like or have on hand. To make overnight oats vegan, we use almond milk but coconut milk or cashew milk will work just fine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Chia Seeds: These ultra nutritious, low-calorie seeds boast their own list of health benefits! They also act as an oatmeal thickener, but you can leave them out if you aren’t a fan.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                         Other optional mix-ins & toppings:

The mix-ins and additions will differ depending on the flavor of oatmeal you’re making.
                         <li>
     Nut or seed butter: Almond butter, cashew butter, pumpkin butter, sunflower seed butter and or peanut butter add that savory-nutty flavor and a certain creaminess.
                         </li>
                         <li>
     Fruit: Have fun with your toppings. Add fruit that won’t get mushy directly into the mason jar or toss them on directly on top of the oats when you’re ready to eat.
                         </li>
                         <li>Sweetener: Leave out or use any sweetener you like – honey, maple syrup, a ripe banana, dates or any low-carb liquid sugar substitute or sweetener such as monk fruit, SWERVE or erythritol will work.
     For a non-vegan version, you can make overnight oats with yogurt – Add a combination of milk and Greek yogurt to make your oats extra creamy
                         </li>
                    </ul>

               <b>Directions</b><br>
               BASIC OVERNIGHT OATS RATIO:
               <ol>
                    <li>
                         1/2 cup old fashioned rolled oats
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         3/4 cup liquid (water or your favorite milk)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         COMBINE INGREDIENTS: Start by adding the rolled old fashioned oats with your favorite milk and / or coconut or Greek yogurt in a 8 oz. mason jar, resealable container or a bowl. These 7 oz jars are the ones you actually see in the photos and are currently my favorite ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         FLAVOR WITH SWEETENER OR SPICES: Overnight oats are super versatile so feel free to add any sweetener or spices you like.
CHILL IN FRIDGE: Seal or cover with a lid and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         MIX UP THE FLAVORS: There are a ton of ways you can customize the flavors. Have fun and mix up the flavors so you can have a different one every day of the week.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         EAT IN JAR OR BOWL: And if you make them in a mason jar, you can easily transport this healthy breakfast to school, work or enjoy them on the road. Enjoy them straight from the jar or pour into a bowl and add your favorite toppings.
                    </li>
